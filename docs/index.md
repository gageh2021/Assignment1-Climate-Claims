### Climate Claims Articles
1. #### [Article 1: ](https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/ipcc-report-shows-desperation-not-climate-catastrophe)IPCC Report shows desperation, not climate catastrophe
   * Claim: In this article, the author claims that the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report fails to represent the proportion of climate change caused by natural forcings such as solar irradiance, and that poorly-understood feedbacks are included in climate models which result in catastrophic, inaccurate predictions.
   * Rationale: I was prompted to rethink my faith in climate models after reading this article as it describes the degree of uncertainty in natural forcings represented in modelling and provides statements from a number of reputable sources emphasizing that climate models grossly overestimate future warming.
1. #### [Article 2: ](https://judithcurry.com/2021/04/10/how-we-fool-ourselves-part-ii-scientific-consensus-building/)How we fool ourselves. Part II: Scientific consensus building
   * Claim: In this commentary, Judith Curry emphasizes that research in climate science is subject to confirmation bias because we have accepted a consensus on anthropogenic climate change, encouraging groupthink among researchers and dissuading disagreement.
   * Rationale: By applying concepts to psychology to climate research, this source caused me to question the scientific method as it offered a new perspective to evaluate the scientific community using a series of clearly-established criteria.
1. #### [Article 3: ](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/finally-the-ipcc-has-toned-down-its-climate-change-alarm-can-rational-discussion-now-begin-)Finally, the IPCC has toned down its climate change alarm. Can rational discussion now begin?
   * Claim: This Spectator article compares IPCC reports to demonstrate that predictions of climate scenarios have failed and suggests that we may never be able to effectively model future warming—this is the basis for poor decision-making and stems from a blind faith in scientific findings.
   * Rationale: The author provides information from the IPCC which contradicts its own modelling predictions, as well as examples of climate advocates who do not have a scientific background, which undermined my belief in our ability to predict climate change and the validity of our decision-making.
1. #### [Article 4: ](https://www.foxnews.com/us/ipcc-climate-change-reports-claims-challenged-by-skeptics#:~:text=%22The%20alarm%20bells%20are%20deafening,General%20Secretary%20Antonio%20Guterres%20said)Scientists challenge 'alarm bells' in IPCC climate change report: 'Not the end of the world'
   * Claim: This article claims that the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report predicts catastrophic climate scenarios which are beyond reasonable predictions based on the current evidence, and that this alarmism is due to the fact that the IPCC and its scientists were selected for the purpose of supporting anthropogenic climate change.
   * Rationale: The article prompted me to question the validity of the IPCC’s findings as I do not have knowledge of how scientists are selected to participate in Assessment Reports, nor am I aware of the political and financial supporters of the IPCC and how this influences its research.
1. #### [Article 5: ](https://financialpost.com/opinion/climate-change-consensus-among-the-misinformed-is-not-worth-much)The con in consensus: Climate change consensus among the misinformed is not worth much
   * Claim: In this Financial Post op-ed, Ross McKitrick argues that there is little evidence to suggest a 97% scientific consensus for anthropogenic climate change, and that this rhetorical tactic disguises the fact that many climate ‘experts’ do not have a complete understanding of the issue.
   * Rationale: McKitrick cites results from a number of surveys which undermine the 97% consensus, which makes me question whether I should blindly accept that anthropogenic climate change is true without knowing exactly who contributes to this consensus and their level of expertise.

### Article Analysis
#### Article of Interest: Sterling Burnett, H., 2021. IPCC Report Shows Desperation, Not Climate Catastrophe. [online] The Heartland Institute. Available at: <https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/ipcc-report-shows-desperation-not-climate-catastrophe>.

Burnett’s 2021 article claims that the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) intentionally assigns natural forcings no role in climate because they are poorly understood. Citing the outputs of climate models from past Assessment Reports, Burnett highlights that projections are worsening as the range of predicted temperatures has increased with each model. The author concludes that anthropogenic forcing is minimal because there have been many severe climatic shifts in the pre-industrial era attributed to natural factors. Burnett implies that the IPCC has come to these false conclusions because they are a “government body, not a scientific endeavour” which serves to aid governments in manipulating the economy.<br/><br/>
This article is of significance because it reduces our faith in climate models, the IPCC, and anthropogenic climate change. These claims are dangerous because they suggest that the scientific community is acting in service of political motivations. They imply that the scientific method is not capable of mitigating confirmation bias and, most importantly, undermine the consensus that human actions drive rapid climate change. 
The credibility of the article is poor. Burnett caters his commentary to the general public, paraphrasing results from scientific studies and the AR6 without citations. This minimizes accountability and prevents the reader from verifying the information provided. Presenting a mixture of opinions and evidence, Burnett disguises his use of the *ad hominem* fallacy, offering a biased perspective on the IPCC. Statements such as “this is truly atrocious nonsense” and “never once has the IPCC undertaken an honest assessment” speak to the reader’s emotions, yet are integrated with quotes and data from reputable sources.<br/><br/>
	Examining Burnett’s arguments reveals that many claims are generalizations based on evidence lacking context. For example, the author claims that the influence of solar variations is ignored in climate modelling because it is included with numerous other forcings as “Internal Variability”, which has minimal influence on temperature. Burnett fails to identify that IPCC reports project temperature changes on anthropogenically-relevant timescales (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2021). Solar variations may have affected the climate throughout geological time (Haigh, 2003), yet IPCC projections demonstrate “negligible long-term influence from solar activity” since the pre-industrial era (*Figure 1*). This is reiterated elsewhere (Haigh, 2003). Here, the fallacy is that because the IPCC does not predict solar variability will influence climate in the period of interest, it discounts this factor as a potential climate forcing.<br/><br/>

  Moreover, the author bemoans the fact that modern climate models are predicting temperature changes with a wider range than “the earliest, less complex climate models”. This is intuitive and should not undermine our certainty in projected temperatures. As climate models grow more complex, they incorporate a greater number of dimensions and earth system feedbacks (Watson, 2008). This means that while there is greater uncertainty in projected temperatures, the information is more representative of the real-world processes.<br/><br/>
	Burnett claims that since natural causes have created severe climate changes in the past, there is no reason to believe that anthropogenic factors are involved. This ‘either/or’ fallacy implies that anthropogenic and natural forcings cannot jointly contribute to climate change. While the author correctly describes examples of naturally-derived changes over time, he fails to recognize that the __*rate*__ at which human impacts are occurring is unprecedented, and that climate changes cannot be attributed to natural forcings alone because of this rate of change. This is supported by peer-reviewed literature (Zeebe, Ridgwell and Zachos, 2016; Rosenzweig et al., 2008).<br/><br/>
While Burnett is qualified, with experience in climate policy and a background in environmental philosophy, his article is neither peer-reviewed nor scholarly and is affiliated with the Heartland Institute, a conservative climate scepticism group (Medimorec and Pennycook, 2015). The purpose of the article is ostensibly to persuade the reader against the IPCC’s AR6 findings and is not credible from a logical or scientific standpoint.

### Reflection

After reading a variety of articles with claims about climate change, I noticed that many use targeted rhetoric to undermine empirically-supported evidence. Vocabulary such as “the IPCC admits”, “this ignores”, and “nonsense” create a negative connotation with climate research, while phrases such as “it is clear” and “the truth is” suggest that the claims being made are unequivocal. Authors often employ the ad hominem fallacy, attacking the individuals or institutions which oppose their claims rather than the claims themselves. These appeals to emotion distract readers from assessing the quality of the commentary. Ironically, many articles imply that climate science is subject to confirmation bias while cherry-picking evidence to support their claims from valid sources which are taken out of context. Skeptics also rely upon the hasty generalization fallacy, implying that the findings of the scientific community are intentionally misleading or subject to bias, despite a lack of supporting evidence.
